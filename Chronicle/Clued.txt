## Number I
This ain't the start, nor a riddle,
You  may start off solo, 
like a snack with no dip,
But teammates might join for this mystery trip.
It'll take some time, so let’s roll the dime,
But remember HERE, there's no crime.

To find the location,
You must join FunPhantasie’s Nation.
This ain’t a riddle, just a clue,
Your birthday fun isn’t just for you.
