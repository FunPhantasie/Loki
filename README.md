If you made it so far,<br/> 
Congratulations — I will now<br/>
lower the bar.<br/>
<br/>
The image tags might show<br/>
some information you maybe didn’t know.<br/>
You knew? Okay, then no...<br/>
(Sad noises)<br/>
<br/>
Go further — the choice is yours.<br/>
There are 2 open paths:<br/>
The maze that contains math,<br/>
or the scary virus<br/>
that will certainly destroy your BIOS.<br/>
<br/>
The timing of paths, in order,<br/>
creates a powerful, guarded border,<br/>
that shields against all the threats,
by using for example the function sleep(inf),
there the Computer dies without a beep.
Then — and only then your system is clean
and you can finally open
the lock thats needs to be broken
to the can of the sweet sweet sugar bean.
