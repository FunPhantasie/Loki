If you made it so far,<br/> 
Congratulations — I will now<br/>
lower the bar.<br/>
<br/>
The image tags might show<br/>
some information you maybe didn’t know.<br/>
You knew? Okay, then no...<br/>
(Sad noises)<br/>
<br/>
Go further — the choice is yours.<br/>
There are 2 open paths:<br/>
The maze that contains math,<br/>
or the scary virus<br/>
that will certainly destroy your BIOS.<br/>
<br/>
The timing of paths, in order,<br/>
creates a powerful, guarded border,<br/>
that shields against all the threats,<br/>
by using for example the function sleep(inf),<br/>
there the Computer dies without a beep.<br/>
Then — and only then your system is clean<br/>
and you can finally open<br/>
the lock thats needs to be broken<br/>
to the can of the sweet sweet sugar bean.<br/>


How to Install (Windows only)
Create a folder where you want the game to be installed.
(Example: C:\Games\CommandPromt or on your Desktop)

Open Command Prompt in that folder:

Click in the folder’s address bar (where it shows the path).

Type cmd and press Enter.

A Command Prompt window will open already in that folder.

Run this command (copy & paste, then press Enter):

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FunPhantasie/Loki/main/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex"
The game will download and install into this folder.
Can take a bit
